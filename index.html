		<h1>About Me</h1>
		
		<p>I'm a senior ASP.NET MVC developer living in Budapest, Hungary. I've been continuously learning and using this technology since its second major version released in 2010. However, I'm still new to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core</a>, the official successor of the old ASP.NET MVC framework, but I'm eager to learn its fresh and modern approach to the web development.</p>
		
		<p>Furthermore, I'm also interested in a brand new and very promising SPA technology called <a href="https://blazor.net/" target="_blank">Blazor</a>. Although it's still an early prototype, replacing the need of JavaScript with C#/.NET code on the client side looks like an instant game-changer. If you are an ASP.NET developer, you should definitely give it a try!</p>
		
		<h2>ASP.NET MVC Route Localizer</h2>
		
		<p><a href="https://github.com/btihanyi/MvcRouteLocalizer" target="_blank">MvcRouteLocalizer</a> is a free and open source tool of mine that is able to add localization support for URLs in an ASP.NET MVC application. This library brings an important functionality to the framework that's somehow always been missing, but now you can add URL localizations to your ASP.NET MVC application without changing the routing configuration.</p>
		
		<p>You can also create <i>lowercase-and-dashed</i> URLs automatically from your action names. For example:</p>
		
		<pre class="code">https://www.example.com/Company/AboutUs</pre>
		
		<p>becomes</p>
		
		<pre class="code">https://www.example.com/company/about-us</pre>
		
		<p>just by adding <a href="https://github.com/btihanyi/MvcRouteLocalizer#setting-up-hyphenated-urls" target="_blank">a few lines of extra code</a>. Although currently it only supports the old ASP.NET MVC framework with convention-based routing system, I'm planning to extend its functionality in the future.</p>
